     * specification.
     *
     * Additionally, it should be noted that the registered {@link Filter}s are
     * effectively associated with a particular {@link HttpContext}.  Therefore,
     * if you wish to have multiple filters associated with a particular
     * {@link javax.servlet.Servlet}, then you should use the same {@link HttpContext}
     * instance to perform the registration.
     *
     * {@link Filter}s will be invoked in registration order.
     *
     * This method will invoke {@link Filter#init(javax.servlet.FilterConfig)} during
     * the registration process.
     *
     * When registering a {@link Filter}, take care not to reuse the same Filter
     * instance across multiple registration invocations.  This could cause issues
     * when removing the Filter as it may remove more url matching possibilities
     * than intended.
