  <title>Core Configuration</title>

  <para>The primary points of configuration of the core framework are that of
  the Transport instances and their associated thread pools. The ability to
  configure both entities is possible via the NIOTransportBuilder.</para>

  <section>
    <title>Transport Configuration</title>

    <para>Just as there are concrete NIOTransport implementations for TCP and
    UDP, so too are there two concrete NIOTransportBuilder implementations.
    Each NIOTransportBuilder implementation exposes configurable features
    unique to each transport. The following describes configuration properties
    common to all NIOTransports and then describes the properties for the TCP
    and UDP NIOTransport implementations.</para>

    <para>The thread pool configuration is fairly straight forward. However,
    it should be noted that Grizzly, internally, has several thread pool
    implementations: SyncThreadPool, FixedThreadPool, and
    QueueLimitedThreadPool. Which implementation is chosen is based on the
    configuration. The following sections describe each of the thread pool
    implementations.</para>

    <section>
      <title>FixedThreadPool</title>

      <para>This pool will be selected when the queueLimit property is less
      than zero, and the max and core pool sizes are the same. The
      FixedThreadPool has no syncronization when executing tasks, so it offers
      better performance.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>QueueLimitedThreadPool</title>

      <para>This pool will be selected when the queueLimit property is greater
      than zero, and the max and core pool sizes are the same. The
      QueueLimitedThreadPool is an extension of the FixedThreadPool, so if
      offers the same benefits of the FixedThreadPool without having an
      unbounded task queue.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>SyncThreadPool</title>

      <para>This pool will be selected when none of the criteria for the other
      thread pools apply. This thread pool does have syncronization to have
      precise controll over the decision of thread creation.</para>
