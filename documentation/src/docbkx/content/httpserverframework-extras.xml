  <section>
    <title>Multipart (multipart/form-data) HTTP Requests Processing</title>

    <para>File sharing has become a very popular internet service where users are able to upload
            files and share them for group of people. Typically users will upload their files via a
            regular HTML form
            like:<programlisting language="xml">&lt;form action="upload" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
  &lt;input type="text" name="description"/>
  &lt;input type="file" name="fileName"/>
  &lt;input type="submit" value="submit"/>
&lt;/form></programlisting></para>
    <para>where after you press "submit",  a multipart HTTP request is generated. For the example
            above, the HTTP request will contain two parts: text description and chosen file
            content,
            like:<programlisting>POST /upload HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:18080
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: en-us,en;q=0.7,uk;q=0.3
Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=---------------------------78965753017082023611608934090
Content-Length: 357

-----------------------------78965753017082023611608934090
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="description"

some text file
-----------------------------78965753017082023611608934090
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="fileName"; filename="test.txt"
Content-Type: text/plain

TEST
-----------------------------78965753017082023611608934090-- </programlisting></para>
    <para>When using the Grizzly http-server module, the content of the message above will be
            represented as one single message together with boundaries.  This means the user will be
            responsible for parsing content himself or use an existing library (which, most likely,
            will process processes multipart requests in a blocking fashion).</para>
    <para>The Grizzly http-server-multipart module provides an API which simplifies multipart HTTP
            requests processing and does so in a non-blocking fashion. At the core of the API is the
            MultipartScanner, containing two "scan" methods:<itemizedlist>
                <listitem>
                    <para>Top level multipart HTTP request scanner (multipart/form-data)</para>
                    <programlisting language="java">public static void scan(final Request request,
        final MultipartEntryHandler partHandler,
        final CompletionHandler&lt;Request> completionHandler);</programlisting>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para>multipart/mixed entries
                        scanner<programlisting language="java">public static void scan(final MultipartEntry multipartMixedEntry,
        final MultipartEntryHandler partHandler,
        final CompletionHandler&lt;MultipartEntry> completionHandler);</programlisting></para>
                </listitem>
            </itemizedlist></para>
    <para>By calling one of the methods above, we initialize asynchronous multipart request
            processing which is going to be handled by the provided MultipartEntryHandler (which is
            very similar to HttpHandler) and ultimately passed CompletionHandler will be notified
            about multipart HTTP request processing (i.e., success or error).</para>
    <para>The MultipartEntryHandler API is very simple and looks very similar to
      HttpHandler:<programlisting language="java">/**
 * General interface for processing {@link MultipartEntry}s, one by one.
 * 
 * @since 2.1
 */
public interface MultipartEntryHandler {
    /**
     * The method is called once {@link MultipartEntry} header is ready to be
     * processed by user code.
     * 
     * @param part {@link MultipartEntry}
     * @throws Exception
     */
    public void handle(final MultipartEntry multipartEntry) throws Exception;
}</programlisting></para>
    <para>Inside the handle(...) method we're able to process the passed multipart entry, check its
            content type, disposition etc., and finally initialize the asynchronous non-blocking
            processing of an entry's content using either the NIOInputStream (binary mode) or the
            NIOReader (text mode) API described in the http-server <link linkend="hsf-nio-streams"
                >section</link><programlisting language="java">NIOInputStream nioInputStream = multipartEntry.getNIOInputStream();</programlisting></para>
    <para>or<programlisting language="java">NIOReader nioReader = multipartEntry.getNIOReader();</programlisting></para>
    <para>Please note, unlike the NIOInputStream and NIOReader got from HTTP Request, the
            implementations provided by MultipartEntry expose the  content of a single multipart
            entry and report end of stream once end of multipart entry is reached. </para>
    <para>Also it's important to understand that multipart message processing is asynchronous, so we
            have to suspend HTTP request processing before starting the scan.   Also, don't forget
            to resume the HTTP request processing inside the passed CompletionHandler. See
            http-server <link linkend="hsf-suspend-resume">section</link> for more information on
            HTTP request suspend/resume.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Sample</title>
      <para>Let's see how a file-uploader implementation may be implemented.</para>
      <para>First of all let's create HttpHandler, which would be responsible for multipart HTTP
                requests
                processing:<programlisting language="java">public class UploaderHttpHandler extends HttpHandler {
    private static final String DESCRIPTION_NAME = "description";
    private static final String FILENAME_ENTRY = "fileName";

    // uploads counter (just for debugging/tracking reasons)
    private final AtomicInteger uploadsCounter = new AtomicInteger(1);

    /**
     * Service HTTP request.
     */
    @Override
    public void service(final Request request, final Response response)
            throws Exception {
        
        // Suspend the HTTP request processing
        // (in other words switch to asynchronous HTTP processing mode).
        response.suspend();

        // assign uploadNumber for this specific upload
        final int uploadNumber = uploadsCounter.getAndIncrement();

        // Initialize MultipartEntryHandler, responsible for handling
        // multipart entries of this request
        final UploaderMultipartHandler uploader =
                new UploaderMultipartHandler(uploadNumber);

        // Start the asynchronous multipart request scanning...
        MultipartScanner.scan(request,
                uploader,
                new EmptyCompletionHandler&lt;Request>() {
            // CompletionHandler is called once HTTP request processing is completed
            // or failed.
            @Override
            public void completed(final Request request) {
                // Upload is complete
                final int bytesUploaded = uploader.getBytesUploaded();
                
                // Compose a server response.
                try {
                    response.setContentType("text/plain");
                    final Writer writer = response.getWriter();
                    writer.write("Completed. " + bytesUploaded + " bytes uploaded.");
                } catch (IOException ignored) {
                }

                // Resume the asychronous HTTP request processing
                // (in other words finish the asynchronous HTTP request processing).
                response.resume();
            }

            @Override
            public void failed(Throwable throwable) {
                // Complete the asynchronous HTTP request processing.
                response.resume();
            }
        });
    }
}</programlisting></para>
      <para>The important part in the code is calls to response.suspend() before starting the
                multipart request scanning and response.resume() once multipart HTTP request is
                processed.</para>
      <para>Now we're ready to take a look at the UploaderMultipartHandler code, which is
                responsible for processing single multipart
                entries:<programlisting language="java">    /**
     * {@link MultipartEntryHandler}, responsible for processing the upload.
     */
    private final class UploaderMultipartHandler
            implements MultipartEntryHandler {
        
        // upload number
        private final int uploadNumber;
        // number of bytes uploaded
        private final AtomicInteger uploadedBytesCounter = new AtomicInteger();
        
        public UploaderMultipartHandler(final int uploadNumber) {
            this.uploadNumber = uploadNumber;
        }
        
        /**
         * {@inheritDoc}
         */
        @Override
        public void handle(final MultipartEntry multipartEntry) throws Exception {
            // get the entry's Content-Disposition
            final ContentDisposition contentDisposition =
                    multipartEntry.getContentDisposition();
            // get the multipart entry name
            final String name = contentDisposition.getDispositionParamUnquoted("name");

            // if the multipart entry contains a file content
            if (FILENAME_ENTRY.equals(name)) {

                // get the filename for Content-Disposition
                final String filename =
                        contentDisposition.getDispositionParamUnquoted("filename");

                // Get the NIOInputStream to read the multipart entry content
                final NIOInputStream inputStream = multipartEntry.getNIOInputStream();

                // start asynchronous non-blocking content read.
                inputStream.notifyAvailable(
                        new UploadReadHandler(uploadNumber, filename,
                        inputStream, uploadedBytesCounter));

            } else if (DESCRIPTION_NAME.equals(name)) { // if multipart entry contains a description field
                // skip the multipart entry
                multipartEntry.skip();
            } else { // Unexpected entry?
                // skip it
                multipartEntry.skip();
            }
        }

        /**
         * Returns the number of bytes uploaded for this multipart entry.
         * 
         * @return the number of bytes uploaded for this multipart entry.
         */
        int getBytesUploaded() {
            return uploadedBytesCounter.get();
        }
    }</programlisting></para>
      <para>Inside the handle(...) method we check if the multipart entry represents a file to be
                uploaded, because as we mentioned in the beginning, the HTTP multipart request
                contains two multipart entries: one for description and the second for actual file
                content. If the multipart entry represents a text description, we just skip it by
                calling multipartEntry.skip(). However, if multipart entry represents file content,
                we start the asynchronous content reading using NIOInputStream.</para>
      <para>Let's see how our asynchronous ReadHandler looks
        like:<programlisting language="java">    /**
     * Simple {@link ReadHandler} implementation, which is reading HTTP request
     * content (uploading file) in non-blocking mode and saves the content into
     * the specific file.
     */
    private class UploadReadHandler implements ReadHandler {

        // the upload number
        private final int uploadNumber;
        // Non-blocking multipart entry input stream
        private final NIOInputStream inputStream;

        // the destination file output stream, where we save the data.
        private final FileOutputStream fileOutputStream;
        
        // temporary buffer
        private final byte[] buf;

        // uploaded bytes counter
        private final AtomicInteger uploadedBytesCounter;
        
        private UploadReadHandler(final int uploadNumber,
                final String filename,
                final NIOInputStream inputStream,
                final AtomicInteger uploadedBytesCounter)
                throws FileNotFoundException {

            this.uploadNumber = uploadNumber;
            fileOutputStream = new FileOutputStream(filename);
            this.inputStream = inputStream;
            this.uploadedBytesCounter = uploadedBytesCounter;
            buf = new byte[2048];
        }

        /**
         * {@inheritDoc}
         */
        @Override
        public void onDataAvailable() throws Exception {
            // save available file content
            readAndSaveAvail();

            // register this handler to be notified next time some data
            // becomes available
            inputStream.notifyAvailable(this);
        }

        /**
         * {@inheritDoc}
         */
        @Override
        public void onAllDataRead() throws Exception {
            // save available file content
            readAndSaveAvail();
            // finish the upload
            finish();
        }

        /**

         */
        @Override
        public void onError(Throwable t) {
            // finish the upload
            finish();
        }

        /**
         * Read available file content data out of HTTP request and save the
         * chunk into local file output stream

         */
        private void readAndSaveAvail() throws IOException {
            while (inputStream.isReady()) {
                // read the available bytes from input stream
                final int readBytes = inputStream.read(buf);
                // update the counter
                uploadedBytesCounter.addAndGet(readBytes);
                // save the file content to the file
                fileOutputStream.write(buf, 0, readBytes);
            }
        }

        /**
         * Finish the file upload
         */
        private void finish() {
            try {
                // close file output stream
                fileOutputStream.close();
            } catch (IOException ignored) {
            }
        }
    }</programlisting></para>
      <para>As you can see, the logic is pretty simple.  Once the ReadHandler is notified about data
                being available, we read the data off the NIOInputStream and store it to a local
                file. If we expect more data, we just re-register the ReadHandler to wait for it to
                be notified.  If there is no more data to be processed, finish the upload by closing
                the local file output stream.</para>
