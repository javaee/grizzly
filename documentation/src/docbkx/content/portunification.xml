  <title>Port Unification</title>

  <section>
    <title>Overview</title>

    <para>When implementing a network application which provides several
    network services such as Web server (HTTP, HTTPS), Corba, JMS, we may
    think about how these services will be published.</para>

    <para>The natural way of publishing different types of services - is to
    make them available on separate TCP ports (one TCP port per service).
    Usually HTTP is published on port 80, HTTPS 443, and so on. There might be
    no problems with that approach; the service consumer just must remember
    its own TCP port number, but sometimes, due to certain admin restrictions,
    we're not able to make all the required TCP ports available for the
    external consumers on Internet. What if we're limited just by one TCP port
    accessible for the external (Internet) service consumers? For that case,
    we have to have a solution which let's us share a single TCP port among
    different services and, depending on incoming service request, redirect it
    to the corresponding service. This solution is called Port
    Unification.</para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>How it works</title>

    <para>Port Unification, in Grizzly, is represented by PUFilter which is a
    Grizzly 2.0 FilterChain Filter. This filter plays role of a fork in the
    FilterChain.</para>

    <para>Each "unified" protocol, should be represented by a object
    pair:<itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis role="bold">ProtocolFinder</emphasis>, which is
          responsible for parsing incoming data and figuring out if the data
          belongs to the specific protocol;</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis role="bold">FilterChain</emphasis>, represents
          specific protocol FilterChain.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist></para>

    <para>So the final FilterChain will look like:</para>

    <para><inlinemediaobject>
        <imageobject>
          <imagedata fileref="../images/portunification/portunification-diagram.png"></imagedata>
        </imageobject>
      </inlinemediaobject></para>

    <para>For better usability, Grizzly Port Unification introduces the
    PUProtocol abstraction, which holds ProtocolFinder + FilterChain
    pair.</para>

    <para>The picture above is not complete, one piece is missing. We can
    imagine how new data comes from network, comes into main FilterChain, it
    redirects it to the corresponding protocol FilterChain.</para>

    <para>But what about opposite direction? Imagine HttpServerFilter wants to
    send data back to the client, so it constructs HttpPacket and send it by
    the custom protocol FilterChain. HttpFilter intercepts the HttpPacket,
    decodes it into a Buffer and... there is no Filter in the custom protocol
    FilterChain to pass the Buffer to, so it never comes to TransportFilter
    and never gets sent! In order to fix that, we need to add utility back
    channel Filter as the first Filter in the protocol FilterChain, which will
    be reponsible for redirecting custom protocol FilterChain processing back
    to the main FilterChain. So finally complete picture will look
    like:</para>

    <para><inlinemediaobject>
        <imageobject>
          <imagedata fileref="../images/portunification/portunification-diagram2.png"></imagedata>
        </imageobject>
      </inlinemediaobject></para>

    <para>The PUFilter logic could be described using follwoing flowchart
    diagram:</para>

    <title>Sample</title>

    <para>Assume we have two services: add and sub, which are responsible for
    adding and subtracting passed integer values. The services protocol could
    be descibed by the following ABNF:<itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis role="bold">add</emphasis><programlisting
          language="java">protocol  =  magic
             value1
             value2
magic     =  "add"
value1    =  INT
value2    =  INT
INT       =  4*BYTE
BYTE      =  OCTET</programlisting></para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist><itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis role="bold">sub</emphasis><programlisting
          language="java">protocol  =  magic
             value1
             value2
magic     =  "sub"
value1    =  INT
value2    =  INT
INT       =  4*BYTE
BYTE      =  OCTET</programlisting></para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist></para>

    <para>From the protocol description, it's obvious we can distinguish two
    services and their protocols by 3-bytes magic header, add-service has
    "add", sub-service "sub". So it's what service's ProtocolFinder should
    address. For example add-service ProtocolFinder may look
    like:<programlisting language="java">/**
 * {@link ProtocolFinder}, responsible to determine if incoming byte buffer
 * represents ADD-service request.
 */
public class AddProtocolFinder implements ProtocolFinder {

    private final static byte[] magic = {'a', 'd', 'd'};

    /**
     * {@inheritDoc}
     */
    @Override
    public Result find(final PUContext puContext, final FilterChainContext ctx) {
        // Get the input Buffer
        final Buffer inputBuffer = ctx.getMessage();

        final int bytesToCompare = Math.min(magic.length, inputBuffer.remaining());
        
        final int bufferStart = inputBuffer.position();

        // Compare incoming bytes with ADD-service protocol magic
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; bytesToCompare; i++) {
            if (magic[i] != inputBuffer.get(bufferStart + i)) {
                // If at least one byte doesn't match - it's not ADD-service protocol
                return Result.NOT_FOUND;
            }
        }

        // if we check entire magic - return FOUND, or NEED_MORE_DATA otherwise
        return bytesToCompare == magic.length ?
            Result.FOUND : Result.NEED_MORE_DATA;
    }

}</programlisting></para>

    <para>The add-service FilterChain will contain two Filters:<itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis role="bold">AddServerMessageFilter</emphasis>,
          responsible for parsing/serializing add-service messages</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis role="bold">AddServiceFilter</emphasis> the actual
          service implementation</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist></para>

    <para>The PUProtocol initialization and registration for add-service will
    look following way:<programlisting language="java">        // Create PUFilter
        final PUFilter puFilter = new PUFilter();

        // Create ADD-service ProtocolFinder
        final ProtocolFinder addProtocolFinder = new AddProtocolFinder();

        // Create ADD-service FilterChain
        final FilterChain addProtocolFilterChain =
                puFilter.getPUFilterChainBuilder()
                // Add ADD-service message parser/serializer
                .add(new AddServerMessageFilter())
                // Add ADD-service filter
                .add(new AddServiceFilter())
                .build();

        // Construct PUProtocol
        final PUFilter addServicePUProtocol = new PUProtocol(addProtocolFinder, addProtocolFilterChain);

        // Register add-service pu protocol
        puFilter.register(addServicePUProtocol);</programlisting></para>

    <para>Similar coding is required for the sub-service. Finally port
    unification Filter (PUFilter) should be added to the main FilterChain and
    Transport could be started<programlisting language="java">        // Construct the main filter chain
        final FilterChainBuilder puFilterChainBuilder = FilterChainBuilder.stateless()
                .add(new TransportFilter())
                .add(puFilter);

        // Build TCP transport
        final TCPNIOTransport transport = TCPNIOTransportBuilder.newInstance().build();
        transport.setProcessor(puFilterChainBuilder.build());

        // Bind to the server port
        transport.bind(PORT);
        // Start
        transport.start();</programlisting></para>

    <para>Complete sample code could be found <link
    xlink:href="http://java.net/projects/grizzly/sources/svn/show/branches/2dot0/code/samples/portunif/src/main/java/org/glassfish/grizzly/samples/portunif">here</link>.</para>
