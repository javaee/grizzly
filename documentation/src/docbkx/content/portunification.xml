  <title>Port unification</title>

  <section>
    <title>Overview</title>
    <para>When implementing network application, which provides several network services, such as
      Web server (HTTP, HTTPS), Corba, JMS, we may think about how these services will be
      published.</para>
    <para>The natural way of publishing different types of services - is to make them available on
      separate TCP ports (one TCP port per service). Usually HTTP is published on port 80, HTTPS 81
      etc... There might be no problems with that approach, the service consumer just must remember
      its own TCP port number, but sometimes, due to certain admin restrictions, we're not able to
      make all the required TCP ports available for the external consumers on Internet. What if
      we're limited just by one TCP port accessible for the external (Internet) service consumers?
      In that case we have to have a solution, which let's us share single TCP port among different
      services, and depending on incoming service request, redirect it to the corresponding service.
      And this is what Grizzly port unification is about.</para>
  </section>
  <section>
    <title>How it works</title>
    <para>The port unification in Grizzly is represented by PUFilter. which is a Grizzly 2.0
      FilterChain Filter, this filter plays role of a fork in the FilterChain.</para>
    <para>Each "unified" protocol, should be represented by a object pair:<itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis role="bold">ProtocolFinder</emphasis>, which is responsible for parsing
            incoming data and figuring out if the data belongs to the specific protocol;</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis role="bold">FilterChain</emphasis>, represents specific protocol
            FilterChain.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist></para>
    <para>So the final FilterChain will look like:</para>
    <para><inlinemediaobject>
      <imageobject>
        <imagedata fileref="../images/portunification/portunification-diagram.svg"></imagedata>
      </imageobject>
    </inlinemediaobject></para>
    <para>For better usability, Grizzly port unification introduces the PUProtocol abstraction,
      which holds ProtocolFinder + FilterChain pair.</para>
