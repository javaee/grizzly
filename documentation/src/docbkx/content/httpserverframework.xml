              HTTP-related features such as keep-alive, chunked
              transfer-encoding, cusom addons etc. HttpServer can support
              multiple NetworkListeners. Also, keep in mind that all

              across all listeners.</entry>

      <title>Quick Start</title>

      <para>To get started with the HTTP server framework you'll need to
      include the module in your project:</para>

      <programlisting language="xml">&lt;dependencies&gt;
    &lt;dependency&gt;
        &lt;groupId&gt;org.glassfish.grizzly&lt;/groupId&gt;
        &lt;artifactId&gt;grizzly-http-server&lt;/artifactId&gt;
        &lt;version&gt;@project.version@&lt;/version&gt;
    &lt;/dependency&gt;
&lt;/dependencies&gt;</programlisting>

      <para>Once the dependencies are in place, the absolute simplest, albeit
      not-very-useful, server one can create is:</para>

      <programlisting language="java">HttpServer server = HttpServer.createSimpleServer();
try {
    server.start();
    System.out.println("Press any key to stop the server...");
    System.in.read();
} catch (Exception e) {
    System.err.println(e);
}</programlisting>

      <para>This will create a Grizzly HTTP server listening on 0.0.0.0:8080
      and will serve content from the directory in which the JVM was started.
      As stated before, while this demonstrates the ease of embedding Grizzly,
      it's not very useful.</para>

      <para>Let's add a HttpHandler to server the current time.</para>

      <programlisting language="java" linenumbering="numbered">HttpServer server = HttpServer.createSimpleServer();
server.getServerConfiguration().addHttpHandler(
    new HttpHandler() {
        public void service(Request request, Response response) throws Exception {
            final SimpleDateFormat format = new SimpleDateFormat("EEE, dd MMM yyyy HH:mm:ss zzz", Locale.US);
            final String date = format.format(new Date(System.currentTimeMillis()));
            response.setContentType("text/plain");
            response.setContentLength(date.length());
            response.getWriter().write(date);
        }
    },
    "/time");
try {
    server.start();
    System.out.println("Press any key to stop the server...");
    System.in.read();
} catch (Exception e) {
    System.err.println(e);
}</programlisting>

      <para>Line 2 adds a new HttpHandler (think Servlet) to service requests
      make to /time. Any other requests to the server will be considered
      requests for static content served from the direction in which the JVM
      was started.</para>

  <section xml:id="hsf-suspend-resume">
    <title>Long-lasting HTTP requests (suspend/response)</title>

    <para>Some HTTP interactions may need to trigger a long running
    transaction on the server and wait for the result to generate a response.
    However, this can be problematic with an NIO-based server as there are
    generally a handful of threads servicing all requests. A long running
    transaction in this case would tie up one of the processing threads
    preventing it from servicing other requests. If enough of these long
    running transactions were initiated, it could lead to a denial of
    service.</para>

    <para>To support these use cases without negatively impacting the server,
    Grizzly allows a response to be suspended until such time that the long
    running task is complete and the response is ready to be generated.</para>

    <para>Let's cover the methods related to response suspend/resume. The
    following methods are available on the Response object itself:</para>

     * or {@link Response#cancel()}), the {@link Response} will be automatically
     * resumed and committed. Usage of any methods of a {@link Response} that

    <para>The "Suspended Response Queue" warrants some explaination. If a
    suspended Response has defined a timeout, it will be added to the
    "Suspended Response Queue". When the queue is processed, the current time
    will be evaluated against the timeout as defined within the Response's
    SuspendContext. If the timeout has been exceeded, the response will be
    committed and the Response object within the queue will be marked for
    removal. So in the case no timeout has been defined, the response will not
    be added to the queue, and the task may run indefiniately.</para>

    from the request and read data in a non-blocking manner. As far as

      <para>The general idea behind non-blocking writes holds true for

      non-zero return from readyData(). If no data can be read without
      blocking, use notifyAvailable(ReadHandler) or
      notifyAvailable(ReadHandler, int). When data is becomes available, the
      ReadHandler will be invoked. Note that if no length is provided to the
      notifyAvailable() methods, the ReadHandler will be invoked as soon as
      any data becomes available. In this case, it's a good idea to check how
      much can be read by another call to readyData().</para>

          remaining data is echoed back to the client and the response is resumed.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>Now we need to create a server and install this HttpHandler:</para>

        <para>lWhen the connection is established with the server, the handleConnect() method of
          this Filter will be invoked. When this happens, we create a HttpRequestPacket, which

    <para>Lastly we need to define a client that utilizes the Filter that was

    <para>The comments within the Client code should be sufficient to explain
    what's going on here. When running the complete example the output will
    look something like:</para>

    <para>A quick note about the output above, the (delay 2 seconds) isn't
    actually output. It's been added to visualize the artificial delay added
    by the Filter used by the client.</para>
