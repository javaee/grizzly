  <para>This chapter will present how to get started with Grizzly 2.0, both
  client and server side.</para>

  <para>First, it is necessary to depend on the correct Grizzly 2.0 <link

  artifact. Maven developers will need to add following dependency to the
  pom:<programlisting>&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;org.glassfish.grizzly&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;grizzly-framework&lt;/artifactId&gt;

    &lt;url&gt;http://download.java.net/maven/glassfish/&lt;/url&gt;
&lt;/repository&gt;</programlisting></para>

  <para>Let's implement simple Echo client-server application. The client will
  get user's data from standard input, send data to Echo server and redirect
  server's response to the standard output. The responsibility of the Echo
  server is to read data from network channel and echo the same data back to
  the channel.</para>
