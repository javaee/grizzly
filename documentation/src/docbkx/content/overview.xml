    <title>Goals of the Grizzly Framework</title>

    <para>Writing scalable server applications in the Java™ programming
    language has always been difficult. Before the advent of the Java New I/O
    API (NIO), thread management issues made it impossible for a server to
    scale to thousands of users. The Grizzly NIO framework has been designed
    to help developers to take advantage of the Java™ NIO API.</para>

    <para>Our hope is to help developers to build scalable and robust servers
    using NIO and we are also offering extended framework components such
    as:</para>

        <para>HTTP Prototcol framework for creating custom HTTP
        applications</para>

      <listitem>
        <para>HTTP Server framework which offers high level abstractions to
        the HTTP protocol (not unlike Servlets)</para>
