/**
 * This configuration might be useful, when Grizzly HttpServer is running
 * behind an HTTP gateway like reverse proxy, load balancer etc...
 * 
 * In this situation the HTTP gateway may preprocess initial HTTP request
 * headers, examine them and forward modified HTTP request to a Grizzly HttpServer.
 * For example HTTP request received via HTTPS might be forwarded using plain HTTP
 * (for performance reason), so the protocol and client authentication might
 * be lost when the HTTP request reaches Grizzly HttpServer.
 * Using this configuration object, it's possible to instruct Grizzly HttpServer
 * to use custom HTTP request headers to get information about original protocol
 * used by client, user authentication information etc...
