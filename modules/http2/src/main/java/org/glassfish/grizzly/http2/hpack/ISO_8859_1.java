//
// The rationale behind this is not to deal with CharsetEncoder/CharsetDecoder,
// basically because it would require wrapping every single CharSequence into a
// CharBuffer and then copying it back.
//
// But why not to give a CharBuffer instead of Appendable? Because I can choose
// an Appendable (e.g. StringBuilder) that adjusts its length when needed and
// therefore not to deal with pre-sized CharBuffers or copying.
//
// The encoding is simple and well known: 1 byte <-> 1 char
