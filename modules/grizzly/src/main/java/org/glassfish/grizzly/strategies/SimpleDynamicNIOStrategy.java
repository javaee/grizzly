/**
 * Simple dynamic strategy, which switches I/O processing strategies, basing
 * on statistics. This implementation takes in consideration number of
 * {@link java.nio.channels.SelectionKey}s, which were selected last time by
 * {@link java.nio.channels.Selector}.
 *
 * <tt>SimpleDynamicIOStrategy</tt> is able to use 2 strategies underneath:
 * {@link SameThreadIOStrategy}, {@link WorkerThreadIOStrategy}.
 * And is able to switch between them basing on corresponding threshold
 * (threshold represents the number of selected
 * {@link java.nio.channels.SelectionKey}s).
 *
 * So the strategy is getting applied following way:
 *
 * {@link SameThreadIOStrategy} --(worker-thread threshold)--> {@link WorkerThreadIOStrategy}.
