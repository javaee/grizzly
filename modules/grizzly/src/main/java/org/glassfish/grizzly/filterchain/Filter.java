/**
 * A Filter encapsulates a unit of processing work to be performed, 
 * whose purpose is to examine and/or modify the state of a transaction that is 
 * represented by a {@link FilterChainContext}. Individual Filter can be assembled
 * into a {@link FilterChain}, which allows them to either complete the required 
 * processing or delegate further processing to the next Filter in the 
 * {@link FilterChain}.
 *
 * Filter implementations should be designed in a thread-safe manner, 
 * suitable for inclusion in multiple {@link FilterChain} that might be 
 * processed by different threads simultaneously. In general, this implies that 
 * Filter classes should not maintain state information in instance variables. 
 * Instead, state information should be maintained via suitable modifications to
 * the attributes of the {@link FilterChainContext} that is passed to the
 * appropriate {@link Filter} processing methods.
 *
 * Filter implementations typically retrieve and store state information
 * in the {@link FilterChainContext} instance that is passed as a parameter
 * to the appropriate {@link Filter} processing methods,
 * using particular {@link Attribute}s that can
 * be acquired via {@link Attribute#get(org.glassfish.grizzly.attributes.AttributeStorage)} method.
