/**
 * Example of HTTP server, which assigns different priorities (thread-pools)
 * to registered {@link HttpHandler}s.
 * 
 * Suppose we have two types of web applications ({@link HttpHandler}s)
 * registered on {@link NetworkListener}. One of them is high-priority
 * application we want to get response from as fast as possible (say some
 * core service we use to check if server is running). Other application runs
 * a long-lasting task, which may occupy a worker thread for significant
 * amount of time, so, considering the thread-pool is limited, may impact other
 * applications availability.
 * 
 * How we can separate these two applications?
 * There are two options:
 * 1) we can use HttpHandler suspend/resume mechanism
 * 2) lower level by-Request prioritization mechanism, which allows us to dispatch
 *      a Request processing to a proper thread-pool before passing control to
 *      {@link HttpHandler#service(org.glassfish.grizzly.http.server.Request, org.glassfish.grizzly.http.server.Response)} method.
 * 
 * In this example we take the the 2nd approach...
