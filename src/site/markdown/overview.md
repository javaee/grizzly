## Goals of the Grizzly Framework

Writing scalable server applications in the Java™ programming language
has always been difficult. Before the advent of the Java New I/O API
(NIO), thread management issues made it impossible for a server to scale
to thousands of users. The Grizzly NIO framework has been designed to
help developers to take advantage of the Java™ NIO API.

Our hope is to help developers to build scalable and robust servers
using NIO and we are also offering extended framework components such
as:

-   HTTP Protocol framework for creating custom HTTP applications

-   HTTP Server framework which offers high level abstractions to the
    HTTP protocol (not unlike Servlets)

## System Requirements

The system requirements for Grizzly 2.3 are quite simple.
Basically, Grizzly is able to run on any platform that [JDK
1.8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/index.html) is available on.

## Source code

Grizzly source may be viewed online on the Java.net git
[repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/r).

## Where to Get Help

There are several ways to obtain help with Grizzly. The first resource
is the [project mailing lists](http://java.net/projects/grizzly/lists).
The Grizzly team is very responsive to any mails sent to these lists.
The second resource is the [project issue
tracker](https://github.com/javaee/grizzly/issues). If you find a bug with
Grizzly, or have recommendations on how to improve Grizzly, this is the
place to do it.
